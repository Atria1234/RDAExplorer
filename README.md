# RDAExplorer

The RDAExplorer is a Windows Application that can read and save the RDA file format used in Anno 1404, 2070 and 2205.

**Note:** Adjustments for the new file format used in Anno 2205 is still in early stages. For example, encrypted blocks cannot be read, and will be missing from the saved file. If you encounter any bugs, please let me know by creating an issue. Pull requests are also welcome :)
